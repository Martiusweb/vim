# Martius' .vim configuration

## Quick installation

```
git clone https://Martiusweb@github.com/Martiusweb/vim.git
cd vim && ./install.sh
```

## About

I updated my vim configuration to make it fit with my current needs. It primary
focuses on Python, php and javascript developpement (nobody's perfect).

I gathered a lot of tips I've seen across the web, but most of this
configuration is based on the configuration from my frient Paul (github:
padenot/.vim).

## Vim newbie

I still have a lot to learn with vim, and sometimes I need a cheatsheet. I made
one that you can display pressing F2!
